# Aesophia ACI Encoder
Efficiently interact with AEternity smart contracts written in Sophia using a JSON ACI.

# Features:
- AEVM calldata encoding
- FATE VM calldata encoding
- Supports Sophia_AEVM_01 and Sophia_FATE_01 ABI
- Depending on the contract and the specific computer encodes calldata for the FATEVM in ~100us
- Standalone - does not require aesophia

# Sophia compiler compatibility:
The following table shows whether an ACI generated by a particular compiler will work

| Compiler Version | Supported |
|------------------|-----------|
| 1.4.0 | NO  |
| 2.0.0 | NO  |
| 2.1.0 | YES |
| 3.0.0 | YES |
| 3.1.0 | YES |
| 3.2.0 | YES |
| 4.0.0 | YES |
| 4.1.0 | YES |
| 4.2.0 | YES |
| 4.3.0 | YES |
| 4.3.1 | YES |

# Missing features:
- Polymorphism on records
- Polymorphism on Algebraic Data Types is incomplete
- Type adnotations in calldata...
- FATE VM, AEVM calldata decoder
- Nice error messages
- Hardening against malicious JSON ACI's(ACI's not generated by the compiler)

The missing features are really easy to add and will be added if they are deemed important.
